# Fermentation mechanistic models

In this repository, you can find different models for the aerobic or anaerobic growth of microorganisms.
The models are implemented as an object and they are based on determistic principles.
In this library you can find:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Herbert-Monod in aerobic conditions
 \item Herbert-Monod in anaerobic conditions
 \item Aerobic growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in glucose (with metabolic switch controlled by the Cabtree Effect/Overflow and glucose inhibition)
 \item Anaerobic growth of M succiniproducens in glucose (The growth of the microorganisms is described by Monod equation while the Luedeking-Piret model can represent the formation of organic acids)
 \end{itemize}
